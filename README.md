## Introduction and purpose
This project is developed for Java101 on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of the project is to find ```n```<sup>th</sup> element of Fibonacci series and print to screen. Naturally, ```n``` is entered by user via keyboard.

## Algorithm
Please check out transactions below:
        0 + 1 = 1

        1 + 1 = 2
       
        1 + 2 = 3
       
        2 + 3 = 5
       
        3 + 5 = 8
       
After each summation, number which is positioned to left side of sum operator is equated to right side of operator, and number which is positioned to right side of sum operator is equated. After repeating this process we can find nth element of Fibonacci series. To find higher ```n```<sup>th</sup> elements, i used type of double for each variable. Greetings.
